Fast Dictionary Learning with a Smoothed Wasserstein Loss. To appear in Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2016, Cadiz, Spain. JMLR: W&CP volume 41.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a script to reproduce the experiment in the introduction of the article step by step.\r\n\r\nSee LICENCE.txt for copyright and warranty information.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to start using Wasserstein Dictionary Learning is to open up matlab and run all sections of the script test_wassersteinDL_mixture1d.m\r\n\r\nThe main function is wasserstein_DL.
